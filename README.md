# code-tober-intro-to-ml

These notebooks are taken from (1, 2 & 5) and inspired by (3, 4) foundational work by Evgeny Naumov (qdbp on Github) for the Physics and AI workshop May 2019, Montreal. They will be used in the Intro to Machine Learning workshop for Code-tober, a series of workshops organized in preparation for the McGill Physics Hackathon taking place November 2-3 2019.
